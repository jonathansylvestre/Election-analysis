# Election-analysis
Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide control information to the Colorado Board of Elections for a recent local election. The goal of this audit is to provide the board with the total number of votes cast, a list of the candidates who received votes, the total number of votes each candidate received, the percentage of votes of each candidate. Additionally, the election commission requested the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county, and the county with the highest turnout.

•	369,711 votes were cast in the congressional election.
•	County Votes: Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855), Denver: 82.8% (306,055), Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
•	Denver County had the largest voter turnout
•	The Candidate Results: Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213), Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892), Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
•	Diana DeGette won the election with 272,892 votes which accounted for about 74% of the total votes.
Election-Audit Summary
In conclusion, the audit has provided substantial evidence that the winner was elected by a landslide. This script can be used to audit elections across any platform. To further dissect the data, there are other ways that the script can be altered for gaining insight in other elections. One of the ways can be to find out what percentage of each county did each candidate receive votes for. This will provide insight on whether the candidates should decide to focus their political ambitions in those respective counties in the future or where they should focus more of their campaigning on to gain more support. Additionally, the script can be altered to find out if the same Ballot ID appeared in other counties. This will aide in the controls of the election to ensure that votes aren’t duplicated.
